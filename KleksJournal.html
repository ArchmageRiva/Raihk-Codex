			<p>I fear for poor Ekkoran. Starmantle's ascension to the Council has hit him hard. I've spotted him multiple times drinking in his office - an event that typically only happens during periods of intense crisis. But this feels different. Usually, he drinks when he's off-duty, to help himself forget the crap he has to put up with every day. He never drinks when he's working.</p>
			
			<p>Or at least, so I thought.</p>
			
			<p>They have serious issues. Massive, even for someone of Ekkoran's age. I'm not sure what the details are, but Ekkoran talks about Starmantle as if he bears some kind of responsibility for his behavior. I've no idea why. The two have no relations, and should have every reason to ignore each other.</p>
			
			<p>Yet just a few nights ago, I heard them through the door. They were screaming at each other the way that only people who know each other <b>very well</b> do. Could they be lovers, perhaps? A scandal like that is the last thing Ekkoran needs right now. I've never seen him hit his limit before, but... between all our typical work, our efforts on Rake Orata and Syhni, worries about the Emperor's death, and the constant belittling from the other Councilors... maybe I'm about to.</p>
			
			<p>Storms, I hope I don't. Ekkoran may be the only decent Councilor in existence. If he were to go off the deep end like Marbleslide or Ironbreak, then things would get so much worse.</p>

			<p>I know I shouldn't write about our work. Ekkoran has demanded total secrecy, but I'm not like him. I can't keep all of these webs in my head without being smothered by them. What's happening on Rake Orata is colossal. The public unrest has worked in our favor, but the breaking-down of the democratic process for Rake Orata's new Planetary Governor is unheard-of in our generation. No matter who wins the race—and who knows how long it'll take, between demanded re-counting and internal investigations of voter fraud—the public's trust in the process is going to be damaged in our favor.</p>
			
			<p>I can't help but be worried, though. No, not worried. I'm terrified. We are toying with the lives of billions upon billions of people, in secret, with no oversight. Like we're Ascellants. And the moment we make a misstep, we risk not only our deaths, but the deaths of hundreds, maybe even thousands of colleagues. Not to mention that Rake Orata is my damned <b>homeworld</b>. Ekkoran expects me to just be silent about the whole process, but we've been reckless of late. The money will be noticed sooner or later. It's just a matter of time until one of us doesn't cross a T or dot an I, and the Cessasis burst in to drag us to our doom.</p>
			
			<p>What's worse: I think Ekkoran knows this. I think he's convinced it'll happen soon. I need to talk to him.</p>
			
			<p>One help us.</p>
