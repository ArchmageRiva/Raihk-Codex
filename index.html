		<p>To the Illustrious Prime Ruler Stargrip,</p>

		<p>I understand the precariousness of the situation. Dealing with sorcerers is, at the best of times, a dangerous and unpredictable endeavor. A sorcerer that has something you want is wont to invite even more chaos to the situation. While I understand that secrecy is paramount—I will not ask exactly why you want this sorcerer, nor what their abilities are—the fact that you are involved at all is testament to the importance of this particular subject.</p>

		<p>That said, the Initiative exists for a reason. No-one in Raihk has a better understanding of the danger sorcerers present, nor is better-equipped to capture and protect them from their own abilities. Stormslicer is our greatest physician - there is not a hysk alive who can help you understand your target better than him.</p>

		<p>I know you have a personal distaste for our work. Past experiences have colored your understanding of the Initiative. Nonetheless, I urge you to reconsider your decision to involve us - no-one is more capable than we are of bringing your sorcerer in.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, the Initiative has the right by law—a law that, I must point out, you are bound by—to seek out and contain sorcerers wherever they are found. If you do not involve us in this operation immediately, I will seek legal action against you. Please, do not make this any more difficult than it already is.</p>

			Prime Administrator, Magic-Gifted Sorcerer's Initiative</p>
